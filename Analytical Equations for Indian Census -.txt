Analytical Equations :-


1. females/males = Sex_ratio

2. females+males = Population

3. females = males-population

4. (Population - males) = (Sex_ratio)*males

5. Population = males(Sex_ratio + 1)

6. males = Population/(Sex_ratio + 1)

7. females = Population-Population/(Sex_ratio + 1)
